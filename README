The testbed should consist of one or multiple "servers" with IP connectivity to each
other. Each server should be assigned a globally-unique server ID from 1 to 65535.
On each server, there could be one or multiple "nodes". Each node should be assigned
a node ID from 1 to 127 that is unique on the server where the node resides.

Each server is assigned a /24 network determined by its server ID, and each node is
assigned a /31 network which is a subnet of the /24 network of the containing server.
The IP address of a node is fully-determined by the server ID of the containing
server, and the node ID. Servers maintain GRE tunnels to each other so that they can
route LAN packets across the public internet.
